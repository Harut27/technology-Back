        content: `Ready for Thursday every week night football? So are we and what a season it's already been for the NFL - jam-packed with incredible interceptions, receptions and hand-offs. With this being the 100th NFL season, it's safe to say the stakes and tensions are high. With over nine weeks and 90+ games to go, all you have to do is sit back, (try to) relax and watch your team shoot for the Super Bowl. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Not sure where to watch?  Luckily for you TechRadar has produced this very handy guide to getting an NFL live stream...no matter where on Earth you are.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What a spectacular season it has been so far, filled with plenty of interceptions, touchdowns, and incredible passes. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some wins include the Patriots comeback after their first loss this season, they've already got two wins under their belt - they beat the Cowboys and the Eagles.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Although the Dolphins have had a couple of losses, they managed to convert NFL's second successful onside kick of 2019. Sutton's trick play for the Broncos along with Tim Patrick's 38-yard catch was a particularly impressive play and example of teamwork.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Teams that are ranking high and to watch out for the next games are the 49ers, Saints, Ravens and Patriots.

        Missed a couple games or ready for your next football fix?  Luckily for you we’ll show you how to live stream NFL action no matter where you are in the world. Keep reading to find out the best ways to stream NFL live on all your devices with information on the NFL Game Pass, International Game Pass (well worth finding out about) and network television included.

        How to stream NFL live online with Game Pass
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Watching NFL online has never been easier thanks to the wide variety of streaming services now available. However, the league also has its own streaming service called NFL Game Pass which allows die-hard football fans to watch every game. Just like other modern streaming services, there are also Game Pass apps for Android and iOS mobile devices as well as on the likes of Chromecast, Apple TV, Roku, PS4 and Xbox One.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But there is a catch...the $99 service only allows you to watch replays of games that have already aired on television. This means you won’t be able to watch live games as they happen - so a bit of a bummer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Especially when you consider that the International Game Pass gives its subscribers the ability to see every game of the season absolutely live! It costs around $176 for the required Pro version, but can't be used if you're outside the US..`

        Bluntly speaking - if a deal seems too good to be true, it could well be a scam. This is especially true of offers sent via email, which are used by criminals to lure victims to phishing sites where their personal details are harvested and potentially sold on.
         <br/>
        "Cyber criminals will likely attempt to exploit individuals' desire to seek out sales over the holiday shopping season by crafting email lures advertising sales or pretending to have been sent by popular brands," says Kimberly Goody, Manager, Cybercrime Analysis, FireEye.

        "More other common lures used by malicious email campaigns throughout the year, such as delivery notifications, are also more likely to be successful due to the increased volume of online shopping.” ..`

        content: `Given that Cal Kestis is a fugitive padawan thanks to Order 66, he isn’t quite the Jedi Master you might be expecting when you boot up Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In fact, he’ll quite easily fall foul to the blasters of some rudimentary stormtroopers, or the silly little critters that litter the lush greenery of Bogano and Zeffo. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you’re struggling with the early throes of Cal’s adventure, we’ve picked out a few choice tips to help you bring some momentum to Fallen Order’s combat and stay alive even when you’re outnumbered. Read on for a selection of our favourite Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order tips.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Maybe this won’t be an issue on the lower difficulties, where you can spam your attacks and overwhelm most enemies, but if you’re playing on Jedi Master or above then learning how to parry is absolutely essential. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The timing isn’t quite the same as Sekiro and, if you’re finding it difficult, it’s worth picking up the early skill that gives you more block stamina so you can practice. Unlike Sekiro, the enemies in Fallen Order don’t just use samurai swords, so try and learn how to choreograph each enemies moveset. Big enemies like to attack with one-two combos, whereas Stormtroopers can be easily dealt with from afar by parrying their blaster bolts..
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Don't forget your force powers
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Due to the complexity of the lightsaber combat in Fallen Order it’s easy to forget that you also have an arsenal of force powers at your disposal. We found that halfway through the game we realized we weren’t using them even though they were perfect for disposing of the most difficult enemies. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Throw in a Force Push when any opponent is near a ledge to get rid of them without having to bother with battle. Purge Troopers will no longer worry you if you follow this tactic. Same goes for Force Pull. You can pull enemies out of their attack animations when they’re gearing up to batter you, so use it on late-game robots and monsters, mixed in with your saber slashes`

        category: " How To",
        content: `In Pokémon Sword and Shield, Gigantamax Pokémon are something special. While all Pokémon in the games can grow in size through the new Dynamax feature, Gigantamax Pokémon are more rare, more powerful and they’re capable of some pretty nifty form changes. So of course they’re harder to find. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Fortunately, for players who have previously played either Pokémon Let’s Go Eevee or Let’s Go Pikachu on their Nintendo Switch, there’s an easy way to get your hands on a special Gigantamax version of one of these Pokémon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Pokémon you get depends on the game for which you have a save file, so those with a file for Let’s Go Eevee will receive a Gigantamax Eevee while those with a file for Let’s Go Pikachu will get—you guessed it—a Gigantamax Pikachu. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now, onto how to get them. Like the Hi-Tech Earbuds item in Sword and Shield, getting your hands on these Pokémon is simply a matter of finding and talking to the correct NPCs. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These generous NPCs can be found in the game’s Wild Area, specifically in the train station that’s located in the Meetup Spot zone. If you’re already playing the game you can return there via fast travel and if you’re just starting out you’ll arrive in this location within the first couple of hours of play. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the top left corner of the station, a boy and a girl are talking—these are the NPCs you’re looking for. If your save is for Let’s Go Eevee, talk to the boy, and if it’s for Let’s Go Pikachu, talk to the girl, and they’ll hand over your reward, no questions asked. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It’s as simple as that! You can walk away with your new Gigantamax Pokémon and continue your journey together.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It’s worth noting that like their Let’s Go counterparts, these Eevee and Pikachu cannot be evolved in the game. `

        <br/>
        <br/>
        And now, at long last, it has arrived. On November 12, the long awaited Disney Plus service officially launched (In the US, at least), and with it a whole new Star Wars adventure began with the first episode of The Mandalorian.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Again, if you're reading this article, then you probably don't need us to tell you what to expect from The Mandalorian. Set seven years after the end of the original film trilogy, and long before the arrival of Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren in the new movies, The Mandalorian will be the first live-action Star Wars TV show, and follow a lone hero from the same homeworld as fan-favorite bounty hunter Boba Fett. The eight-episode first season has Iron Man director Jon Favreau at the helm and the likes of Carl Weathers and Gina Carano in the cast – so it's unsurprising that anticipation is feverishly high, with Disney drip-feeding episodes on a weekly basis.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So how do you watch The Mandalorian online? The answer is... it depends. But keep reading and we'll explain all you need to know about getting a stream.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Can I watch The Mandalorian while overseas?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For now, Disney Plus has only been launched in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. You'll have to sit tight if you're reading this from the UK and Europe as the go-live date is set as for March 31, 2020.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So if you're travelling – whether for business or pleasure – and try to log in to your Disney Plus account, you'll soon discover that you're geo-blocked. That is, the service restricts you from watching when abroad.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Usually, we'd boldly say: "No worries! Just use a VPN and change your IP address to one back at home." It seems Disney has worked hard to try and VPN-proof itself but we have no heard that our #1 rated service ExpressVPN has come up with a solution so that you can watch from wherever you wish.

        category: " How To",
        content: `The dark mode trend shows no signs of slowing down, and Gmail is one of the latest apps to receive a dark redesign.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's been some months since iOS 13 and Android 10 arrived, with their system-wide dark modes, but despite being hugely popular on both operating systems, Gmail was one of the last major apps to receive a suitable new color scheme to match.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Dark mode for Gmail is available on both desktop and mobile (with a few caveats, as we'll explain), and there are lots of reasons to give it a try. Firstly, Google's own research indicates that darker pixels draw considerably less power than white ones, meaning dark mode for Gmail should make your battery last a little longer between charges if you're spending a lot of time in the app.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You might also find the dark design kinder to your eyes than the stark white option, and it provides more contrast between read and unread messages, which makes it easier to manage your inbox.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        How to activate dark mode in Gmail for Android
        <br/>
        <br/>
        First make sure you have the latest version of the Gmail app installed by visiting its page on the Google Play Store and checking for an 'Update' button. If no such button appears, you're good to go.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you have Android 10's system-wide dark theme enabled, the app should switch to its new look automatically. Alternatively, you can activate it manually by tapping the menu icon on the top left, scrolling down and tapping 'Settings', then 'General settings'. Here you can change Gmail's theme to either light, dark, or system default.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sadly dark mode isn't available if you're using Android Pie or earlier, but you can still use Gmail in dark mode if you visit Gmail.com in a web browser with dark mode activated. This option is available in Chrome for Android and Firefox Preview `

        <br/>
        Now, we’re well aware that there are several different categories of free software. There’s the stuff that comes from the open source community, which is usually a little rough around the edges owing to its many-cooks approach to development.

        <br/>
        But open source software has its own advantages: sometimes it’s home to experimental features that those in the commercial market might hold back on; or perhaps it’s designed for a niche that commercial developers can’t profit from. There’s also that guarantee that your software is going to stay free – while it might take an age to update and basically come with no warranty, open source software suddenly attempting to dig around in your wallet is a rare occurrence.

        The other side of the coin is 'free' software, in quotation marks. There’s a swathe of it in this list, but we’ve done our best to dodge anything too feature-light.

        subtitle: "Tiger Computing’s Keith Edmunds reveals how Kubernetes can be used to build a secure, resilient and scalable Linux infrastructure",
        category: " How To",
        content: `When you want to use Linux to provide services to a business, those services will need to be secure, resilient and scalable. Nice words, but what do we mean by them?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        ‘Secure’ means that users can access to the data they require, be that read-only access or write access. At the same time, no data is exposed to any party that’s not authorised to see it. Security is deceptive: you can think you have everything protected only to find out later that there are holes. Designing in security from the start of a project is far easier than trying to retrofit it later.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        ‘Resilient’ means your services tolerate failures within the infrastructure. A failure might be a server disk controller that can no longer access any disks, rendering the data unreachable. Or the failure might be a network switch that no longer enables two or more systems to communicate. In this context, a “single point of failure” or SPOF is a failure that adversely affects service availability. A resilient infrastructure is one with no SPOFs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        ‘Scalable’ describes the ability of systems to handle spikes of demand gracefully. It also dictates how easily changes may be made to systems. For example, adding a new user, increasing the storage capacity or moving an infrastructure from Amazon Web Services to Google Cloud – or even moving it in-house. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To understand what’s possible today, it’s helpful to look at how technology projects have been traditionally implemented. Back in the olden days – that is, more than 10 years ago – businesses would buy or lease hardware to run all the components of their applications. Even relatively simple applications, such as a WordPress website, have multiple components. In the case of WordPress, a MySQL database is needed along with a web server, such as Apache, and a way of handling PHP code. So, they’d build a server, set up Apache, PHP and MySQL, install WordPress and off they’d go.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        By and large, that worked. It worked well enough that there are still a huge number of servers configured in exactly that way today. But it wasn’t perfect, and two of the bigger problems were resilience and scalability.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Lack of resilience meant that any significant issue on the server would result in a loss of service. Clearly a catastrophic failure would mean no website, but there was also no room to carry out scheduled maintenance without impacting the website. Even installing and activating a routine security update for Apache would necessitate a few seconds’ outage for the website.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The resilience problem was largely solved by building ‘high availability clusters’. The principle was to have two servers running the website, configured such that the failure of either one didn’t result in the website being down. The service being provided was resilient even if the individual servers were not.

You can watch every Grand Prix of the year from pretty much anywhere on Earth with an F1 live stream  - and this guide will help you find one.

        We were starting to think that the drivers' championship race was effectively over before the season even got half way through, but then finally Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc began to keep Hamilton away from the top of the podium - at least for a few Grand Prix! But it all proved too little too late - Hamilton and Mercedes took the drivers' and constructors' championships once again.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After an exciting Formula 1 season last time around where Lewis Hamilton came out on top with the World Drivers' Championship title and his team Mercedes nabbed the World Constructors' Champion title, it's going to be tough to top. Yet Hamilton has already said that's exactly what he plans to do for 2019 - and he's going the right way about it so far.

        <br/>
        The 2019 F1 season has already featured the 1,000th World Championship race in history, which will take place in China. But the excitement goes far beyond mere marks of measure, with another m-word set to tear up the tarmac – Mercedes. Valtteri Bottas has started the season very strongly, as well.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel finished 2018 as runner-up and you can expect the four-time world champion to push all the way. Vettel is also under pressure as his new teammate and rising star Charles Leclerc replaces Kimi Raikkonen (who finished third overall in 2018) at Ferrari. Raikkonen joins Alfa Romeo Racing–Ferrari for this year. And this season sees McLaren changing from Honda to Renault as engine supplier after too many reliability issues.

        How to live stream F1 motor racing from outside your country
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you're resident in the UK, US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, you can scroll a bit further down this guide to see who's showing the Formula 1 in your country.

        But if you're on holiday or away with work this year you can still catch the races – a good option to help you keep up with all the action live is to use a VPN service. By using this, your device appears to be connected from another country, allowing you to access that service for a live stream of all the races as if you were sat back at home.

        content: `Running Instagram in dark mode can help conserve power (as Google's research has revealed), it's easier on the eyes at night, the contrast can make text easier to read and perhaps most importantly, it just looks cool.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Developers have been scrambling to update their apps with new color schemes in recent months (Google Chrome, Facebook and Twitter have all received makeovers), and Instagram is one of the latest to gain the option.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, enabling dark mode for Instagram isn't as simple as flicking a switch in the app, and it isn't yet available to everyone. As head of Instagram Adam Mosseri notes in a tweet, you need to be running the latest version of the mobile operating system – that is, Android 10 or iOS 13 – to enjoy the dark tones:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Starting today, you can use Instagram in dark mode on iOS 13 or Android 10. Turn dark mode on your phone to try it out. 👀October 8, 2019
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you do happen to have one of those operating systems, Instagram will change color automatically when you activate the device's system-wide dark mode. There's no way to activate dark mode within Instagram itself, but hopefully that will change with a future update.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If and when that happens, we'll update this guide accordingly will full instructions explaining how to make the switch.

        category: " How To",
        content: `It’s an interesting discovery for many companies that you can improve printer speed even for the devices you currently own. While you might assume a printer has to output at a set speed as dictated by the manufacturer, many devices do offer some form of control over this. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Factors such as the network you use, security features being configured incorrectly, the quality of the output, the paper you use, and even whether you have the latest firmware installed can also influence how fast you can print. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In some cases, you can even upgrade the components like the processor and the RAM for an older printer - although it’s recommended to do so through the manufacturer itself and not a third party, which can void the warranty. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Additionally, your overall workflow can impact print speed (or at least the perception of print speed).

        Whether you’ve bought yourself a brand new state of the art record player or you’re blowing the cobwebs off one that’s been collecting dust in your attic for the past few years, it’s important to know how to correctly setup your turntable.

        <br/>
        That’s where we come in: we’ve put together this handy guide to setting up your turntable. It’s worth noting that many cheaper modern turntables come pre-assembled, so you should be ready to play your music straight out of the box; however, the further up the price band you go, the more likely it is that you’ll have to set up your new turntable yourself.
