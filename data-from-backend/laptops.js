        content: `If you're looking for the best mobile workstations of 2019, then you've come to the right place. In this article, we've picked the best, most powerful, business laptops in the world.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        Before we begin, though, what is a mobile workstation? Basically, the best mobile workstations combine the portability of a laptop with the raw power of a desktop PC. These aren't just the best business laptops, however, as they are capable of handling intensive tasks, such as video editing and rendering, while away from the office.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Modern technology has allowed laptops to become ever more powerful, while keeping the same thin and portable designs. In fact, many of the best mobile workstations of 2019 are thinner and lighter than many standard laptops.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This level of performance in a mobile workstation does come at a cost, however, as the parts they use, build quality and the level of after-sales services mean that these are an investment that can be expensive.`

        content: `There’s nothing quite like the best Macs when it comes to computers. Even with increasingly tough competition from Windows laptops, the best Macs and MacBooks certainly occupy a space of their own in the computing world.

        content: `HP is the second biggest PC manufacturer in the world, and sells almost as many machines globally as the Chinese giant Lenovo. Whatever laptop you might be after, HP has a model to cater for you, and the Pavilion range are budget-friendly products designed to maximize value for money.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While the HP Pavilion 15 Horizon Blue Laptop (labeled by HP as the Pavilion 15-cw1063wm) isn’t an out-and-out budget laptop, but rather more of a lower mid-range effort, it still offers an impressive selection of hardware components for the affordable asking price.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This notebook is built around a Ryzen 5 3500U processor, one of AMD’s newest 3rd-gen CPUs, and this is a nifty mobile chip with integrated graphics that can cope with a spot of light gaming (more on that later).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The HP Pavilion 15 is in fact a good all-rounder in many respects, and while we haven’t reviewed this laptop, what we’re doing here is applying our expert notebook knowledge to dig into exactly what’s good – and potentially bad – about this machine.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And furthermore, we’ll also consider how it stacks up against the affordable laptop competition. In that regard, it’s worth bearing in mind that at the time of writing, this particular Pavilion 15 model has yet to get a Black Friday price-cut, and we’ve seen some Ryzen 5-powered notebooks get some seriously big discounts already (even if they aren’t quite as well-specced as HP’s machine). Still, that could all change, and don’t forget we’ll be keeping a close watch on all the best offers – which may eventually include this HP laptop – in our article which is constantly updated with the best Black Friday laptop deals.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: This is a sterling all-rounder of a 15-inch portable which has a good screen. It also benefits from an SSD plus HDD combo which makes for plentiful storage, yet keeps things speedy – and is impressive at this price level.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pros: Commendable IPS screen with slim bezels. Decently well-built. Speedy SSD plus 1TB hard disk.

        subtitle: "Is HP’s Chromebook 15 a good choice for a touch-enabled Chrome OS laptop?",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `HP is one of the most prolific laptop manufacturers in the world, and in fact is only second to Lenovo in terms of global notebook sales. HP makes a huge number of Windows 10 laptops, of course, but is also very active in the Chromebook arena, producing products like the HP Chromebook 14 which features on our list of the best cheap Chromebook deals.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While that 14-inch notebook is designed to be very wallet-friendly, earlier this year HP decided to bring out a bigger 15-inch model to offer more choices to those who fancy running Google’s Chrome OS.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        HP Chromebook 15 at Amazon for US$367.99
        HP’s Chromebook 15 comes with a mid-range price tag – at least for a Chromebook, although it’s still comparatively cheap compared to Windows notebooks – and as such, it’s an unsurprisingly more premium model than the Chromebook 14.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A number of elements make this machine a more compelling proposition than your average bargain basement Chromebook fare, including a good build quality, a full-size keyboard, not to mention the inclusion of a decent quality Full HD touchscreen. There are two spins on the Chromebook 15: one is the non-touch version, and the other is the touch-capable laptop which we are talking about here.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While we haven’t reviewed the Chromebook 15 Touch, what we can do is thoroughly dissect the specs, and explore what makes this machine worthwhile, giving you our expert opinion on whether it’s worth splashing out the cash to buy HP’s notebook.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With any luck, prices on HP’s Chromebook 15 will see some action in Black Friday week, and will get some downward movement hopefully making the machine a more tempting purchase. Don’t forget to keep checking our best Black Friday laptop deals page this week, for all the top bargains on not just HP laptops, but all notebooks.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: A more than solid mid-range Chromebook offering which could be a real tempter for those who want a touchscreen-toting Chrome OS machine with some nice premium touches, including a full-size backlit keyboard.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pros: Powerful enough. Premium look with a smart design. Full-size backlit keyboard. Sharp IPS touchscreen.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cons: Battery life may not be the best. Non-touch model represents a better deal – although Black Friday discounts might change that.`

        title: "Samsung Chromebook 3 – should I buy one?",
        subtitle: "Is Samsung’s Chromebook 3 the perfect pick for your budget laptop?",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `In this guide we're looking at the Samsung Chromebook 3, and if you should buy one.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Samsung is a name that won’t have escaped anyone – except perhaps for freshly arrived travellers from a distant planet – but the company is more known for its smartphones and TVs than laptops. But Samsung does make notebooks, of course, including Galaxy-branded models, and other Windows products, as well as Chromebooks.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We’re focusing on the Samsung Chromebook 3 here, which like a fair number of the laptops running Google’s Chrome OS is a budget product. In fact, this is a very cheap Chromebook, which is one of the big attractions here – and it’s also extremely portable, too.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That’s mainly because the notebook runs with a very compact 11.6-inch screen, and not only is the footprint of the overall device small as a result, but it’s impressively svelte and lightweight.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Naturally, this comes with some compromises, in terms of the hardware components, and in that display being pretty small – about as small as a laptop screen can realistically get. So while this portable is very compact, and very cheap –is it also very much a waste of time? No, the Chromebook 3 isn’t – in fact, we awarded this laptop second place in our roundup of the very best budget laptops.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What’s so great about this machine, aside from the portability and price? We’ll explore that in depth in the next section, and naturally, also point out the main pitfalls with this device.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Remember that this already low-priced Chromebook may well be further reduced with Black Friday discounts, and indeed we’ve already picked out a great offer in our best Black Friday laptop deals. We’ll be constantly updating that page, so it might be an idea to keep it bookmarked to learn about the top offers on all notebooks as they happen.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: This is quite simply one of the best cheap laptops you can buy, and a sterling Chromebook in terms of being highly portable, somewhat rugged, with a good level of battery longevity. There’s lots to like here, even if the screen is pretty small and not the best quality.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pros: Really light and portable. Spill-resistant keyboard. Surprisingly good build quality. Impressive battery life. Great value for money.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cons: Display quality is a bit of a weak point. Keyboard isn’t great to type on either.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This particular Chromebook is used in schools, and it certainly makes a great model for students, as it’s very affordable, along with being convenient to slip in a backpack to carry around – it weighs only 1.18kg, and is 17.9mm thick.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Samsung Chromebook 3 is also solidly built, and is capable of taking a few knocks, which is handy in a classroom environment, or indeed anywhere for that matter.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Spills won’t kill: Not only is the build quality of this budget Chromebook surprisingly good and sturdy, but it also has a spill-resistant keyboard, another reason why it’s great as a laptop for younger ones who might be more prone to drink spillages. That said, the keyboard isn’t particularly great to type on – you won’t want to spend hours typing things up – but it’s serviceable enough, and corners are always going to be cut somewhere on a budget machine.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Battery life: There’s good news here in that the battery gives you up to 11 hours of longevity, and Samsung further claims that the power pack is engineered so the battery capacity doesn’t drop away steeply after a few years of using the laptop (as is often the case).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hardware spec: The spec of this machine is basic, and includes an Intel Celeron (low-end) processor, plus some models have just 2GB of RAM (although many have 4GB). Because Chrome OS is built to be so undemanding, though, the Chromebook 3 is still fine for your everyday light computing usage.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Storage story: As with many bargain basement Chromebooks, however, there’s only 16GB of eMMC storage, which really isn’t much. Although again, Chrome OS is designed with low amounts of drive space in mind, and for users to avail themselves of cloud storage as well as the local drive.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Display dis: The screen is small, of course, and not great with a 1,366 x 768-resolution. This is probably the weakest point of this notebook, but then again, it’s not as if it’s unusable – the display does the job.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Conclusion: If you want a portable, well-built and reasonably tough Chromebook for very little money, then you can’t do much better than this Samsung offering. It has some neat features like a spill-resistant keyboard, and a surprisingly decent build quality at this price bracket. The display and keyboard aren’t the best, but there are always going to be compromises when buying at the lowest-end of the laptop market. Finally, also remember that Chromebooks are very different to traditional Windows laptops (we’ve got an article on whether a Chromebook might be suitable for you, if you’re unsure of the main differences).

        At just over 16mm in thickness and with a weight of 2Kg, it is truly a technological feat.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The nearest rival to it has to be the Dell XPS 15 7590 laptop which doesn’t carry the same cachet as Apple’s newest Mac product but still has a few cards up its sleeve; that is, if you are looking for a Windows 10 PC that approaches what the MacBook Pro 16-inch has to offer.`

        title: "The best laptops to buy your teen this holiday season",
        subtitle: "Upgrade your high schooler’s spring semester",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `It makes complete sense that most parents buy their kids’ new laptops during the back-to-school season (at least chronologically). But in terms of actual savings on expensive hardware, Black Friday easily crushes any summer sale prices. So if your teen is clamoring for a new laptop under the Christmas tree this year, we’re here to help you decide which option best fits their needs and your budget.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first thing to consider is that the best laptops geared towards “kids” probably won’t work for your teen’s needs. Portability, affordability and versatility are good perks for any laptop, but choosing something for durability, limited features or parental restrictions tells your teen you don’t trust them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For high school, a powerful processor becomes a much higher priority. Your teen may need to edit photos and movies for special projects or use 3D modeling software for an elective, and ]some laptops can handle the workload better than others. Plus, from your teen’s perspective, a laptop with good creative apps and powerful specs will help them become 2020’s next Fortnite pro gamer, trending Tiktok star or social media influencer. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At first glance, Chromebooks offer a great solution for young students. They’re lightweight, affordable and secure, with enough battery life to get through the school day. On the other hand, the restriction to Chrome OS or Android apps and a generally low processing power means they’ll sometimes have to rely on inferior software or streaming from another PC for more demanding apps.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On the opposite end of the spectrum, your teen may clamor for a gaming or premier laptop that provides enough power for homework and play. Yet even if you’re okay with a higher price tag, a thick, heavy brick with a battery that’ll barely last through a lunch break may not be practical. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For striking a middle ground, it’s difficult to go wrong with a 2-in-1 laptop. These tablet-laptop hybrids work perfectly as a portable option to whip out in class or on lunch tables, while ensuring your teen won’t also beg for an iPad this Christmas. Plus, depending on your budget, these hybrids can punch well above their weight class in power.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We recommend talking with your teen about what they’d like most in a new laptop: what apps they use most and just how much power they need. Then, with that information in hand, turn this holiday season into back-to-school season 2.0, and use our holiday guide for the best options available on the market.

        Many of those kind of products are pitched towards the premium end of the market, but Lenovo does also make budget laptops.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        Cons: Display isn’t the best. Don’t expect the world in the performance stakes with the Mediatek CPU.

        title: "Save up to $250 in these Dell XPS Black Friday deals - our top laptop of 2019",
        subtitle: "Dell XPS laptops see great savings in Dell Black Friday sales",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `Dell's seasonal sales have started to roll out, and these XPS Black Friday deals offer up to $250 off the incredibly powerful laptop range. For as little as $999 you're getting one of the year's most popular laptops (we recently rated it as the best laptop of 2019), with a specification that can take on anything a power user could throw at it. With the week leading up to Black Friday already underway, here's a closer look at the amazing laptop you could be picking up at an even better price. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The XPS range offers a rarely lightweight design for a laptop of this caliber. That means all that power under the hood won't leave you with house-bound laptop. Instead you've got the best of both worlds with anything up to a 10th generation i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD all sitting in an ultra-thin shell. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The display really is something to behold, as well. An InfinityEdge design keeps bezels skinny but a number of laptops are also offering such full-screen features. Where the XPS shines is in its 4K Ultra HD resolution options, packing 8 million pixels onto your display with an anti-reflective screen and 400-nit brightness. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At up to $250 off, these Dell XPS Black Friday deals are not to be missed, but in case you're looking for something a little different, you can check up on our regularly updated Black Friday laptop deals selection.

        title: "Asus Chromebook Flip C433 – should I buy one?",
        subtitle: "Here’s why the Asus Chromebook Flip C433 might be the perfect pick for a balanced 2-in-1",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `Asus is one of the most well-respected laptop manufacturers around, and offers a diverse range of notebooks, many of which are strong products, and keenly priced too. And set to get an even keener edge, with any luck, when some of said prices are inevitably trimmed come Black Friday.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We are keeping our fingers crossed that the Asus Chromebook Flip C433 will be one of those models that gets such a discount, mainly because the Chromebook Flip is, in fact, our top pick for the best Asus laptop of 2019.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now, note that we haven’t reviewed the exact C433 model highlighted here – we evaluated the C302 in our extensive review, which is the older predecessor model, and has since been supplanted by the Flip C434 and the C433 (the latter laptop which we’re talking about here is a cut-down version of the former).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So, how does the C433 convertible notebook, which is essentially a more wallet-friendly version of the C434, stack up? Read on for our expert buying advice outlining the essential differences, which will help you decide whether the Flip C433 is worth forking out for. Or indeed flipping out for, perhaps.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And don’t forget, we have a page dedicated to highlighting all the best Black Friday laptop deals – Asus or otherwise – which bargain hunters would do well to bookmark in advance of the big day (price-cutting has already started, remember).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: The Chromebook Flip C433 represents a great option for a 2-in-1 Chromebook which maintains a premium look, and indeed some premium features, at a relatively wallet-friendly price – which hopefully Black Friday discounts will make even more tempting.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pros: The ‘nano-edge’ screen looks great, and means a 14-inch display fits into a relatively small laptop chassis. It’s a convertible, so can be both your laptop and tablet. This 2-in-1 is also plenty powerful enough to run all the Chrome OS apps you might want.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cons: Stiff hinge can make this notebook a bit of a pain to open according to some owners. Build quality isn’t as good as its bigger brother the Flip C434. And depending on discounts and exact pricing, that C434 might therefore make a better choice..

        title: "Huawei MateBook 15-inch is a ports paradise, but will it come to the US?",
        subtitle: "It could still happen",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `Huawei MateBook 15-inch is coming, but whether or not it will be available in the US is still anyone’s guess.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        According to MSPoweruser, leaker Evan Blass discovered what could be the first complete renderings of Huawei’s upcoming additions to its MateBook laptops: a 14-inch variant, and a slightly larger 15-inch. And, it’s looking like Huawei’s largest MateBook yet is looking to give Apple’s MacBooks a run for their money – at least, port-wise.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Based on the renders, the Huawei MateBook 15-inch, codenamed Bohr, will be rich in ports, with one USB-C port (likely thunderbolt-enabled and could be used for charging), a full-sized HDMI port and two USB-A ports – not to mention, a headphone jack. In comparison, the MacBook 16-inch also has four ports, but they’re all Thunderbolt 3s, which considerably limits many users still using USB-A compatible devices.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It will also feature Huawei’s fingerprint reader-cum-power button, impressively thin bezels and a 16:9 aspect ratio. While there’s no word yet on what the specs will be, however, the Huawei MateBook 15-inch could be a great alternative for folks who need more of a variety on ports.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        title: "Best laptop for DJs 2019: the best laptops for music production",
        subtitle: "The best laptops for working on your music",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `Still on the fence about getting the best laptop for DJs, trading in your aging and agonizingly slow portable for a more powerful one? You shouldn’t be. Utilizing one of the best laptops for music production makes perfect sense, even if you’re on a budget and think your old laptop will do.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Such a portable machine, after all, is vital if you’re a musician or a professional DJ. You need one of the best processors and plenty of fast RAM, first of all, to smoothly tackle multiple music tracks at a time. And, you’ll also require a fast and spacious storage drive – or a dual drive comprised of both an SSD and a hard drive should be plenty – to save your massive music files in.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And, especially if you’re on the road a lot, you might even need a laptop that's rugged as well as light and thin like an Ultrabook so that it can take a beating or two and is extremely portable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The best thing about shopping around for the best laptop to DJs is that your options are practically limitless. The MacBook Pro may be the default for most musicians, but that doesn’t mean that one that runs Windows 10 won’t be ideal for you.

        subtitle: "These are the best laptops for writers",
        category: " Laptops",
        content: `If you think that the best laptops for writers can be any laptop on the market, you’re sadly mistaken. Writers, much like photographers, video editors and designers, have specific needs when it comes to laptops, even if it seems to outsiders that all they need is a word processing software and a functional keyboard.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As a writer, you have specific needs you’ll want addressed in the laptop of your choosing. First and foremost, you don’t just need a functional keyboard. You need a keyboard that is comfortable to use, has a nice tactile bounce and is very accurate. In fact, you’ll need one of the best keyboards on a laptop, if you hope to type on it all day without fatiguing.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is also true of displays. You’ll need one with an excellent display, one that lets you see things when you’re outdoors and isn’t eye-straining even when you’re indoors. Additionally, the best laptops for writers are ideally sleek and compact, because you never know when inspiration will strike. It could be on your couch in the comfort of your own home, or it could be at a park outside the city. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And, finally, because when inspiration does strike, you never know how many hours you’ll spend writing, it helps to have a laptop with a great battery life as well.

        When the first Super RTX graphics cards launched, they boosted the performance of existing cards. But, they didn't quite manage to outshine what AMD had done with the introduction of the Radeon RX 5700 on a price-to-performance level. AMD's high performance, value, and efficiency thanks to its 7-nanometer architecture helped it get an edge, even if it's not competing at the highest-end.
