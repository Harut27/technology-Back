            <br/>
            <br/>
        Software doesn't come with any more pedigree than this: more than 30 years of imaging expertise underpins the Photoshop brand, and Adobe's claim that the iPad version is compatible with many of the tools and image formats of the full-fat desktop version will have illustrators, designers and photographers salivating into their lattes.

        The launch comes at the perfect time for Adobe. Its transition to a subscription-based model, complete with multi-platform applications and cloud storage, has – with a few caveats – been successful, so bringing the ability to not just view, but open and edit files stored on the cloud makes perfect sense.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Photoshop for iPad is, like the rest of Creative Cloud, a subscription product. That puts it at odds with other excellent iPad editing software such as Affinity Photo, but bear in mind that any subscription that includes Photoshop for iPad also includes other apps.`

        title: "GoPro Hero 7 Black review",
        subtitle: "This former flagship is still the sweet spot for most people",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `OUR VERDICT
        The Hero 7 Black is no longer GoPro's flagship action camera, but its lower price does make it the best value model in its range. Video and stills quality is excellent, the HyperSmooth stabilization makes a huge difference, and it's a lot of fun to shoot with. GoPro's new flagship, the Hero 8 Black, brings a more streamlined design and its forthcoming Mod accessories make it the better option for vloggers. But for everyone else, this version is the sweet spot for performance and value.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The GoPro Hero 8 Black may now be the company's flagship action camera, but the Hero 7 Black has remained on sale in a revamped line-up that sees it sit in between that model and the Hero 7 Silver. Thanks to its price drop, the Hero 7 Black is now the sweet spot for most people, offering the best blend of features and performance that you can find in a tiny, waterproof camera.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When it launched, the Hero 7 Black's USP was its HyperSmooth stabilization, and this remains a very good reason to choose it over older models or its cheaper rivals. A form of electronic stabilization, HyperSmooth largely lives up to its hype as 'gimbal-like' and helps you produce judder-free videos without any editing, even in challenging situations like mountain biking or Go Karting.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Since the Hero 7 Black launched, it's also seen the arrival of a strong challenger in the form of the DJI Osmo Action. This brings a few advantages such as a front display for vloggers and a polished interface, but the Hero 7 Black now matches its price tag and is the more polished option for the money.

        <br/>
        If you're looking to get more creative with your photography, and are on the hunt for your first DSLR, then the Nikon D3500 is hard to beat. It combines great value, intuitive menus and a fantastic battery life to create a compelling, beginner-friendly alternative to its mirrorless rivals.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        DSLRs might seem a little dated compared to more modern mirrorless cameras, but entry-level models like the Nikon D3500 remain good options for beginners.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Why so? DSLRs still have strengths like great handling and battery lives that some photographers will prefer, and they remain a very affordable way to get a camera with a viewfinder.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        All of those appealing traits are present in the Nikon D3500, a relatively new model that builds on the success of its predecessors in Nikon's popular line of affordable DSLRs. It blends excellent ergonomics. solid performance and image quality that goes far beyond what you can expect from a smartphone or most compact cameras.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, the Nikon D3500 also comes with the handy option of being able to change lenses to suit your subject or preferred style of photography, and there are countless options beyond the standard 18-55mm 'kit' lens you'll likely buy with it.

        title: "DJI Osmo Pocket just dropped to its lowest-ever price for Black Friday",
        subtitle: "Save up to 25% on the teeny, gimbal-stabilized video camera",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `One of our big hopes for Black Friday this year was to see a hefty discount on the excellent DJI Osmo Pocket camera – and our dreams just came true, with excellent deals that have slashed the camera's price by 21% in the UK and 25% in the US.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Osmo Pocket is a tiny, gimbal-stabilised camera that lets you shoot sweeping, cinematic 4K videos from something that's no bigger than an electric toothbrush.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        DJI had already announced a £50 discount in its Winter Holiday Sale for the Osmo Pocket in the UK, but now Amazon has taken a further £20 off to bring it down to its lowest price yet of £259. In the US, Amazon has simply slashed $100 off the Osmo Pocket's original price, bringing it down to an unbeatable $299.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As you can tell, we're big fans of this pocketable camera, which is like a miniaturized version of the DJI Osmo Mobile 3. While the latter works with your smartphone, the Osmo Pocket is in many ways more convenient, as it doesn't hold your phone hostage and shoots excellent 4K video at 60fps.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In our tests, we found that the Osmo Pocket shoots slightly better-quality video than today's top-end smartphones. The real difference, though, are those camera moves that the gimbal-stabilized Osmo Pocket can pull off, which allow you to pan and tilt with cinematic smoothness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Another real bonus is the Face Tracking available in the companion app, which makes the Osmo Pocket a fantastic choice for solo vloggers – while you move around, it'll keep your face in the middle of the frame.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There's nothing else out there quite like the Osmo Pocket, which is why it's such a great buy at this new-low Black Friday price.`

        If you've been looking to get into high octane photography but don't want to splash out on the high-end range right from the off, the GoPro Hero 7 White was made for you. It's the most humble of 2018's offerings, but presents an easily accessible route into high quality action video and photography with conservative but impressive specs for its price tag.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You still get the classic touch screen and ready-for-anything exterior shell to protect your GoPro, but if you're after 4K video this isn't the camera for you. That said, you can still shoot in 1080p at up to 60fps with image stabilization, however - an impressive spec at this price point.

        content: `If you're looking for a beginner-friendly DSLR this Black Friday, then it'll be hard to beat this Canon Rebel T7i bundle on offer from Best Buy. Act fast, though, as it's a Doorbuster deal that expires later today.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Canon Rebel T7i (otherwise known as the 800D outside the US) currently sits on top of Canon's entry-level DSLR range, above the newer Canon Rebel SL3. In this deal you get an impressive two lenses for around $100 more than camera body's price, which means it offers incredible value for those just starting their photography journey.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Those two lenses are the 18-55mm IS STM and 55-250mm IS II, which are both optically stabilized and combine well to give you most of the focal lengths you'll need for most types of shooting, from portraits to travel photography. To complete the all-in-one bundle, you also get a camera bag and 32GB SD card, meaning it has everything you need to get started.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Rebel T7i itself has a very solid set of features that make it an ideal camera to learn on, including a 24.2MP CMOS sensor, 6fps burst shooting for capturing speeding objects like pets, and 1080p video recording.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Compared to mirrorless cameras, the benefit of DSLRs like this are their long battery lives (600 shots per charge in this case) and superior handling.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's quite rare to be able to buy an accomplished DSLR like the Canon Rebel T7i with two lenses at this price, so we don't expect to see many better Black Friday deals for those looking to step up from a smartphone or compact camera.

        subtitle: "Snap up the mirrorless camera for just $398",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `The Sony A6000 is one of the most popular cameras of the past few years, and now you can pick one up for its lowest price yet – just $398 in the Black Friday sales, while stocks last.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thanks to a combination of compact dimensions, excellent image quality and superb value, the Sony A6000 has had a longer life than most mirrorless cameras, and become a favorite among YouTubers too. While it doesn't shoot in 4K, it does produce lovely 1080p video and is compatible with a wide range of affordable Sony E-mount lenses too.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It has since been succeeded by the Sony A6100, but at this price the Sony A6000 is almost half the body-only price of that camera and still offers a great feature set by today's standards. It has a 24.3MP APS-C sensor, 11fps burst shooting, an OLED viewfinder and a 3-inch, 921k-dot tiltable LCD screen, which together make it a fine travel camera that'll produce far superior photos to most compact cameras.   
        While the headline deal is that you can buy the Sony A6000 (body only) for just $398, it's worth considering buying one of the many lens bundles – particularly if you're starting from scratch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Walmart is also offering the cheapest price on the Sony A6000 with the 16-50mm kit lens (above), undercutting Best Buy's offer on the same bundle by a whole dollar. This lens is ideal for general purpose shooting, as it gives you the full-frame equivalent of a 24-75mm focal range, which is typical of most kit lenses. The lens also costs around $300 on its own, so that bundle is a good choice for anyone who doesn't have any existing Sony E-mount lenses.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you're buying a Sony A6000 mainly for vlogging or a more specific style of shooting, though, you might be better off going for the $398 body-only deal and getting a more specialist prime lens like the Sony 28mm f/2.8 separately. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While we have seen the Sony A6000's body-only price drop to $398 before, it hasn't dropped lower than that, and has never stayed at that level for very long, making it a good time to buy this mirrorless classic.    `

        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `Black Friday has produced its best action camera deal so far, with huge discounts on the DJI Osmo Action, a new contender that offers GoPro-rivaling performance for a now-bargain price tag.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Osmo Action is an impressive debut action camera from DJI, which is best known for its drones. It combines the ability to record 4K video at 60fps with excellent stabilization to help you shoot smooth clips even in challenging situations like mountain biking or watersports.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Like its GoPro rivals, it offers waterproofing (down to 11m) without the need for a case and a larger touchscreen than the one you'll find on the new Hero 8 Black. It also trumps its main competitor in other areas, including its front screen (which is handy for recording shots to camera) and intuitive, responsive menu system.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Osmo Action is now available in the US with a $70 discount at Walmart, bringing its price down to only $279. That's over $100 cheaper than the GoPro Hero 8 Black right now. In the UK, its price has been slashed by an even bigger 30%, taking it down to £229.
        <br/>
        <br/>  
        GoPro's main advantage over its new competitor is its range of accessories and mounts, although the DJI Osmo Action does come with some adhesive mounts and a quick-release base. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can also buy a range of other accessories for it, including everything from a floating handle for watersports to a more pro-friendly ND filter kit, which helps boost your shooting options in bright conditions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Considering its performance and range of features, the Osmo Action is a fantastic buy at its new Black Friday price, and a great GoPro alternative for those who can't stretch to the pricier Hero 8 Black.

        title: "Mirrorless vs DSLR cameras: 10 key differences",
        subtitle: "Can't decide between a mirrorless and DSLR camera? Here's how to split them",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `Mirrorless vs DSLR: introduction
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The question of whether you should get a mirrorless camera or a DSLR used to be a simple one. If you were a pro – or thinking of becoming one, or wanted a camera that produce the absolute best possible quality images you could imagine – you got a DSLR. If you were a consumer more concerned with weight over image quality, a mirrorless camera was for you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Like we say, simpler times. These days, you’ve got a harder choice to make. There are bargain-basement DSLRs out there and there are monumentally expensive mirrorless cameras at the high end. How are you supposed to choose?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The difference between the two types of camera is in the name. DSLR stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex, and means that once light has passed through the lens, it hits a mirror angled at 45 degrees. The light shoots straight up and into a viewfinder that, when you hold your eye to it, shows you precisely what the lens is seeing at that moment. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It’s a true optical path, with no digital processing in between. When you take a photograph, the angled mirror swings out of the way, revealing an image sensor behind it – it’s why DSLRs make that oh-so-satisfying 'ker-chunk' noise.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A mirrorless camera, unsurprisingly, doesn’t have a mirror. Instead, light goes through the lens, straight onto the sensor, where it is processed and, almost simultaneously, displayed either on the monitor on the back of the camera or on a very small monitor – an Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) on the top. When you push the shutter button, the camera records what’s on the sensor at that moment. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        DSLRs are an established technology that some companies have decades of experience with, and high-end DSLRs in particular are robust, capable of stunning image quality and offer oodles of battery life.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The ditching of the traditional mirror on mirrorless cameras, though, leads to several advantages. Mirrorless cameras don’t need a complicated optical viewfinder or a big mirror to reflect light, which means they can be a lot smaller and lighter. Some jobs, such as autofocus, can be done on the sensor itself, leading to very fast read times that mean some mirrorless cameras are capable of otherworldly performance. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We’re seeing more and more mirrorless cameras with full-frame sensors, too, so at the high end there is no discernible difference between the output of a mirrorless camera and that of a traditional DSLR.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are other advantages and disadvantages besides, though – read on to find out which you should choose.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With no mirror, there's no optical viewfinder. That means that mirrorless cameras rely on either the rear LCD screen or electronic viewfinders for image composition

        title: "Should I buy a GoPro Hero 7 White?",
        subtitle: "Why the Hero 7 White is still a camera worthy of your action",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `Over the past 15 years, GoPro has become a byword for action cameras. And rightly so – its Hero flagships are so polished and feature-rich, they make many rivals look like cheap imitators. But what about GoPro's own budget models, like the Hero 7 White? Does this stripped down version still have the sparkle and performance that makes other GoPros such a popular choice for travelers and extreme YouTubers?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These are the questions we'll be answering here using our expert knowledge of GoPro's range. With the remaining stock of the now discontinued Hero 7 White likely to be heavily discounted in the Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday sales, it's a good time to consider what was already the most affordable GoPro ever. And despite its lowly, entry-level status and recent culling from GoPro's lineup, it's still well worth considering if you're looking for a tough, affordable waterproof camera – here's why.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: For beginners who just want a point-and-shoot action camera with few frills, the Hero 7 White offers very good value. It can’t shoot 4K video, but offers the same waterproofing and usability as more expensive GoPros, for a fraction of the price.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pros: Unlike most budget action cameras, the Hero 7 White’s 1080p video is stabilized and easy to edit in GoPro’s smartphone app. The camera is also waterproof to ten meters without the need for a case, while GoPro’s polished interface makes it both suitable for beginners and fun to use.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cons: It can’t shoot 4K video, which most smartphones can now manage with ease. Also, unlike GoPro’s flagship models, the Hero 7 White’s battery isn't removable, so you can’t carry spares and swap in fully charged ones. It also lacks the latest features like HyperSmooth stabilization and TimeWarp timelapses.

        It was only introduced in 2018, but the Hero 7 White has now been discontinued after GoPro revamped its action cam lineup in September of this year. At the time of its launch, it was the cheapest GoPro available and sat below the Hero 7 Silver and Hero 7 Black, both of which remain on sale.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Still, the brevity of the Hero 7 White's stay in GoPro’s lineup doesn’t mean it isn’t worth considering. Aside from the lack of 4K video, it’s a polished, beginner-friendly action camera that benefits from GoPro’s slick software and waterproof design.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Design: The GoPro Hero 7 White’s waterproofing is rated at 10 ATM, which means you can shoot video while snorkeling or swimming without needing a case. Impressively, that’s the same water-resistance rating as GoPro’s flagship models. While you sadly can’t remove the battery and swap in a fresh one, it is also possible to charge it up with an external battery via its USB-C port, which is handy if you’re out base jumping without easy access to the mains. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Features: The Hero 7 White is quite basic compared to the shiny features available on GoPro’s more expensive models. But is still more versatile and polished than most budget action cameras that you’ll find on Amazon. Compared to the last year's flagship Hero 7 Black, the main features it lacks are HyperSmooth video stabilization, TimeWarp timelapses, live-streaming and GPS. But it does still have decent electronic stabilization, slo-mo video and, importantly for beginners, compatibility with GoPro’s smartphone app. This includes features like QuikStories, which automatically edits together clips from your days out into a souvenir video.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Video and stills: The headline feature missing from the Hero 7 White is 4K video. If your video ambitions end at social media and YouTube, this isn’t necessarily a problem – it’s better to have good quality 1080p video than shoddy 4K, which isn’t uncommon on budget action cameras. Unlike other GoPro cameras, though, you can't change the Hero 7 White's field of view, which means you can only shoot with the trademark fisheye look.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The conclusion: The GoPro Hero 7 White is one of the best budget action cameras you can buy, particularly if you can snap up one of the likely Black Friday or Cyber Monday discounts. It might not be able shoot in 4K, but in every other sense it's ideal for the beginner who just wants to press one button and shoot social media-friendly video.

        subtitle: "CEO backtracks on official stance",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `The winds have changed: just when we thought Olympus wasn't going anywhere any time soon, the company's CEO Yasuo Takeuchi has told reporters that there could be some major changes on the way. According to a Bloomberg report, the company is planning on restructuring "in due course" – which could involve job cuts – to meet its business goals. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Although Takeuchi didn't specify exactly which part of the multifaceted business would see the restructuring, he did follow it up by suggesting there is a possibility Olympus may consider selling the camera division.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Every time rumors surface about Olympus shutting down its imaging arm – something that typically happens at least once a year – pundits say that the Japanese camera maker will sell that side of its business. And each time Olympus has stood firm, stating that the camera division isn't for sale.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While this admission may be disappointing to many (us included), it does make sense from a business perspective. As Bloomberg points out, the imaging arm accounts for just 6% of the company's sales, with the lowest margins and lowest gains. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Takeuchi said that the company will periodically reassess its portfolio in order to focus on its medical division. After all, Olympus does control 70% of the global endoscope supply.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That said, selling the camera arm is still only a thought at the moment, with no firm plans in place yet.

        subtitle: "It's official: Canon has announced the development of its next pro sports DSLR",
        category: "  Cameras",
        content: `With the Tokyo 2020 Olympics approaching faster than a record-breaking javelin, the big camera manufacturers are prepping their new pro-friendly, flagship sports cameras – and one of those is the seemingly imminent Canon EOS 1DX Mark III.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The successor to the EOS 1DX Mark II from 2016 is looking to obliterate the performance of its predecessor in all areas – and from the latest rumors, it looks like it has a good chance of doing so. In fact, it's promising to push Canon cameras into exciting new territory like deep learning A.I-powered autofocus.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So far, Canon has only made a development announcement for the 1DX Mark III with patchy details about specs like autofocus. But the rumor mill has started to flesh out the missing facts like possible release date, so we've combined both to give you this guide to everything we know so far about the new contender for professional sports photographers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, the 1DX Mark III will not be the only new pro-level camera for sports photographers next year – the Nikon D6 is also officially en route in time for the 2020 Olympics. But from what Canon's already revealed about the 1DX Mark III, it's it's likely to run it very close in what could be the final battle between the DSLR behemoths.
