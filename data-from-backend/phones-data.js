Until very recently every iPhone came with a 5W charger, but iPhones have supported fast charging since the iPhone 8: for that you’ll need an 18W charger or better, and it should have a USB-C connector, not the more familiar USB-A.

        iPhones use slightly different wireless charging to Android devices, so it’s crucial that you look for PD (Power Delivery) if fast charging matters to you: that’s the one Apple’s iPhones use. Without it, a fast charger won’t charge, er, fastly

        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's actually pretty rare to find Apple's wireless earbuds on sale, simply because they are one of the most in-demand items in the world of tech. In fact, they still sell out on a regular basis, so if you see an AirPods price, you like, don't think about it for long.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That's right, every time there's a decent AirPods deal, they get snapped up quickly, which isn't great news for those of you looking for a big discount. The AirPods' price is undeniably high, but we're in familiar territory here given Apple's reputation for premium items with the cost to match.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you've picked up a modern iPhone that's dumped the traditional headphone jack, the Apple AirPods rank amongst the best earphones to pair with your new phone. Although, as they're Bluetooth, you can pair them with plenty of other mobile phones too and even laptops. If you're thinking of getting a new phone too, check out the latest offers below.`

        First, there’s a fingerprint icon on the screen, suggesting the fingerprint scanner would be built into the display.

        But there are so many Nokia phones, it can be hard to choose which to buy, if you're on the market.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Never fear, TechRadar's here, and we've made this buying guide to help you find the best Nokia phone out now, and also to compare the various phone models available. We're not including feature phones like the ancient Nokia 3310, this is just a list of smartphones.

        Nokia is always launching new phones, like the Nokia 6.2 and 7.2 launched at IFA 2019, so there's never time to release a definitive list. Instead, our collection is accurate right now. We haven't added these new phones to the list yet, as we're still testing them, but rest assured we'll add them soon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We've included the prices too, but they might dramatically come Black Friday 2019 (and its tech-focused counterpart Cyber Monday 2019 which is, as the name suggests, a few days after).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Black Friday deals bonanza brings huge discounts to many different kinds of products, so the best Nokia phones might see huge discounts. If you're on the market for a new Nokia-branded handset, it may be worth holding out for just a little while.

        Thanks to the hand gesture control and vein scanning tech in the LG G8 ThinQ, or the LG V50 ThinQ's dual-screen option and 5G connectivity, LG phones have something for people who want a handset that's a little... different.

        If you're looking for a new phone and have set your sights on LG, then these are the best phones it sells right now, and we'll run you through what makes them stand out from the crowd.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Has an LG phone caught your eye? Don't forget that Black Friday 2019, and its tech-centric sibling Cyber Monday 2019, are just around the corner. They consist of over a week of sales, both in stores and online, that see a huge range of products reduced.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Smartphones will definitely be amongst the savings, so the best LG phone deals might see them become supremely affordable. There will also probably be LG TVs discounted too, so if you want new tech, it may be worth holding out until then.

        If you’re looking at the best unlimited data plans, having an unlocked phone will give you considerably more options to choose the one that perfectly suits you. And, even if you end up going with one of the flagship unlimited plans like T-Mobile’s Magenta plan or Verizon’s Start Unlimited plan, you’ll have the option to switch to a new, better plan if you find one. And, you’ll get to do so without difficulty from the carriers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There’s more good news, as almost all of the best phones are available unlocked. But, that can make it a little harder to choose. Most of these unlocked phones can work on AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon and most MVNOs, though some GSM-only phones have more limited support, making it trickier still to be sure you’re getting the right phone. `

        content: `Motorola phones, alongside Nokia phones, and certain LG phones, are champions of the budget smartphone market. That means if you're looking for a decent handset that won't break the bank, you're in the right place - especially if you're looking to pick up one at a discount on Black Friday. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Motorola's smartphones run the gamut of lower-end price points, but each has impressive features that may convince you to pick one up. The Moto Z handsets can support additional features - including 5G - with Moto Mods; the Moto G range consists of budget devices with certain impressive specs each; and the Motorola One handsets are wacky and interesting in even more novel ways.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, these phones won't compete with the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S10, but they won't cost you as much either. They're reliable, with impressive specs for their price tag.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The exception, of course, is the officially unveiled Motorola Razr, a throwback to the original's iconic design with a flexible inner screen that technically makes this a foldable. Despite its hefty pricetag - it's fully three times the cost of a Moto Z4 - it isn't the fastest phone; instead, it folds into a footprint half the size of any regular smartphone.
        But the Razr isn't on sale - yet. Once it starts rolling out to consumers (and we've had a chance to test it at length), we'll add it to the list. Until then, we're hopeful for this nostalgia-baiting phone that could break the deadlock of smartphone design.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Motorola has a lot of phones, and tends to release a bunch of new ones at the same time, so it can be a little tough getting your head around the products. That's why we've made this list of the best Moto phones to guide your hand.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We also update this list regularly, when Motorola releases a new phone, or when software updates cause the rankings to shift, so keep checking back to see which devices we recommend the most.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We're approaching the time where Black Friday and Cyber Monday Deals are coming our way - and we're expecting that a few cases deals might start popping up then. So if you think you're OK to wait and not damage your device, you could save some cash - but if the worst does happen then perhaps bookmark our Black Friday iPhone deals page... it could save you a heap of cash. `

        title: "Best phone in the US for 2019: the top 15 smartphones we've tested",
        subtitle: "Our list of best smartphones ranks the Google Pixel 4",
        category: " Mobile Phones",
        content: `Our best phones 2019 list has changed dramatically thanks to new smartphones that keep being released: the Galaxy Note 10 in August, iPhone 11 in September, and the Google Pixel 4 in October. That means it's smartphone shopping season.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Picking up one of these top-tier handsets is an expensive investment, no matter if it comes from Samsung, Apple or Google. Many of these phone prices start at $1,000, so you'll want to take your decision seriously. But don't worry: we're here to guide you through the ins and outs of each...along with our professional opinion about how they rank.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You might be thinking already about saving money with the the forthcoming Black Friday and Cyber Monday Deals - so just bookmark those hyperlinked pages to make sure you're getting access to the top curated deals from across the web by our in-house experts. Yes, these will include phones too - including ones from this list, though the discounts will mostly hit Android handsets.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our idea of the best phone has a big screen, yet is easy to handle; packs a camera suite capable of replacing a point-and-shoot; and has enough processor power and battery to get work done while you're on the go. You won't find slow smartphones with anything less than all-day battery life on this list.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tomorrow's top smartphone? That'll probably be a 5G phone, like the Galaxy S10 5G, and then, eventually, a foldable phone with 5G, starting with the Huawei Mate X and Samsung Galaxy Fold. But foldable phones are unproven, and 5G in the US isn't in enough cities around the country to recommend. Our list will remain practical.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Why we have more than a No. 1 pick: We have a top pick, but not everyone looks for the same smartphone features. Some will demand iOS 13 and cling to Apple's iMessage, while others will want customizations and Google Assistant tools available in Android 10. Our phone reviews and best phone list reflect that diversity. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Likewise, your contract with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile is a preference. The best phone for AT&T may not be available on-contract on Verizon, and vice-versa. While we've seen more unlocked phones in the US in 2019, not all are available for every carrier. We have to take that into account when recommending phones, and we favor those that are completely unlocked or available on the four major carriers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our pick for best phone isn't just crowning the newest iPhone and calling it a day, though our list does have a lot of familiar names: Apple, Samsung, Google and LG, all in the top 15. Newer companies in the US like Huawei and OnePlus make the list, too, though their limited availability is noted.`

        title: "Chrome for Android now has reverse image search powered by Google Lens – here's how to enable it",
        subtitle: "Perform advanced searches using images, not words",
        category: " Mobile Phones",
        content: `Being able to search the web with an image is not exactly a new thing. On the desktop you can drag and drop and image into the Google search engine, and in the Android version of Chrome you can long-press an image to access the option to 'Search Google for this image'.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But searching for an image in this way is a little limited as it involves simply searching for copies of the same image. Now Google has brought the power of Google Lens to Chrome for Android, making it possible to perform much more advanced image-based searches.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So, what's the big deal? Using Google Lens means that the image you are searching with is analyzed so you can search for similar images, not just exact copies. This is extremely handy if you're browsing the web and spot something for your home that you quite like the look of.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But maybe the item you've stumbled across is a little expensive; using a Google Lens image-based search you can easily hunt down something similar. It's also a great way to get new ideas.

        title: "Huawei P40 slated for a global launch despite Google services lockout",
        subtitle: "The P40 could arrive without the Play Store and first-party apps like Maps and YouTube",
        category: " Mobile Phones",
        content: `Despite increased US government scrutiny and a pared-down launch of its previous flagship smartphone, the Huawei P40 is slated for a release in Europe and other overseas markets, sources familiar with internal policies told The Information.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Europe, yes, but it's not clear if Huawei's launch plans includes the US, as the government’s Huawei Ban led to Google shutting the Chinese company’s future phones out of Google Mobile services including the Play Store and first-party apps like Maps and YouTube. (Phones up and until the Huawei P30 line still have access.)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Huawei Mate 30 line was the first to be frozen out of Google’s family, and subsequently, the phone neither launched in the US nor does it have a release date in the UK.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While the US government has given successive temporary Huawei Ban reprieves to rural ISPs - ostensibly to give them time to wean off Huawei - the cutoff from Google’s services forced the Chinese company to develop their own alternatives. Huawei was surprised to discover how dependent Android apps are on Google’s own tools for authentication, notifications, integrating mapping and ad revenue, according to The Information report.
